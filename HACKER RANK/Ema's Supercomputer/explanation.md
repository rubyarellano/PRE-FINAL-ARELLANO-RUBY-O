This function finds the maximum product of the areas of two non-overlapping plus shapes in a grid. Each plus is made up of connected ‘G’ cells extending equally in four directions from a center. The function first checks every cell to see how large a plus can be formed there, saving its area and covered cells. It then compares all pairs of pluses, checking if they overlap. If they don’t, it multiplies their areas and keeps track of the largest product found. Finally, it returns that maximum product.
