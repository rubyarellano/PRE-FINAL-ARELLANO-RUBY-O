This function finds an absolute permutation for given numbers n and k. It first checks if k is zero—if so, it simply returns numbers from 1 to n. If n isn’t divisible by 2 * k, it means no valid permutation exists, so it returns [-1]. Otherwise, it builds the permutation by alternately adding and subtracting k from each position. Every k numbers, it switches between adding and subtracting to ensure the absolute difference condition is satisfied. Finally, it returns the completed permutation.
