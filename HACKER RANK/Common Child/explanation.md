This function finds the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings. It uses dynamic programming to compare characters from both strings one by one. If the characters match, it adds one to the count from the previous diagonal cell. If they donâ€™t, it takes the larger value between the cell above or to the left. After filling the table, the final cell contains the length of the longest common subsequence, which is then returned.
