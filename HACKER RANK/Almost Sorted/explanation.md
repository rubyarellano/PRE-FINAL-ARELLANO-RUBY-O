This function checks if an array can be sorted by either swapping two elements or reversing one continuous subarray. It first compares the given array with its sorted version and notes the indices where the elements differ. If there are no differences, the array is already sorted. If there are exactly two differences, swapping those two elements sorts the array. If more than two differ, it tries reversing the section between the first and last mismatched elements. If that fixes the order, it returns “yes” with the reverse operation; otherwise, it returns “no.”
