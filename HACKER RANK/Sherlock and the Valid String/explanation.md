This function checks if a string is a “valid” string, meaning all characters appear the same number of times, or it can become valid by removing at most one character. It counts the frequency of each character, then counts how many characters share each frequency. If there’s only one frequency, it’s valid. If there are two frequencies, it’s valid only if one frequency occurs once and is either 1 or differs by 1 from the other frequency. Otherwise, it’s not valid.
