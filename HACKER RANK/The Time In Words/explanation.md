This function converts a time given as hours and minutes into words. If the minutes are 0, it says “o’ clock.” If the minutes are 15, 30, or 45, it uses “quarter past,” “half past,” or “quarter to” the hour. For minutes less than 30, it says “minutes past” the hour, and for minutes greater than 30, it says “minutes to” the next hour. It also correctly handles singular and plural for “minute” and wraps hours around 12.
