This function counts how many times a dayâ€™s spending is at least twice the median of the previous d days. It keeps a frequency array to track past expenditures efficiently and uses it to calculate the median without sorting. For each new day, if spending is at least double the median, a notification is added. The frequency is then updated as the window moves forward, and the total number of notifications is returned.
