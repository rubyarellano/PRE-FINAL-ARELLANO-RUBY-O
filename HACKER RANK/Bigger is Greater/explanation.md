This function finds the next lexicographically greater word using the same letters. It first scans from right to left to find the first character that can be swapped to make the word bigger. If none is found, it means the word is the highest possible, so it returns “no answer.” Then, it finds the smallest character to the right that’s larger than this one and swaps them. Finally, it reverses the order of the characters after the swapped position to get the smallest possible next word and returns the result.
