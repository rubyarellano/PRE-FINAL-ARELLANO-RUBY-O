This function finds the minimum number of radio transmitters needed to cover all houses. It sorts the house positions, then places a transmitter at the farthest house within range k from the current starting point. After covering all houses within that transmitterâ€™s range, it moves to the next uncovered house and repeats the process. Finally, it returns the total number of transmitters used.
