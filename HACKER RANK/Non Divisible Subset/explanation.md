This function finds the size of the largest subset where the sum of any two numbers is not divisible by k. It counts how many numbers have each remainder modulo k. For remainder 0 and the middle remainder (if k is even), at most one number can be chosen. For other remainders, it picks the larger count between i and k-i to avoid divisible sums. The total gives the maximum subset size.
