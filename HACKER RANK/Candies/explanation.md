This function distributes candies to children based on their ratings. Each child must get at least one candy, and children with higher ratings than their neighbors must get more. It first goes from left to right, increasing candies when a childâ€™s rating is higher than the one before. Then, it goes from right to left to fix any cases missed in the first pass. Finally, it adds up all the candies and returns the total number needed.
