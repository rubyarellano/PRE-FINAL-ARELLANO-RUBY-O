This function calculates the minimum total cost of buying flowers when k friends share the purchases. The flower prices are sorted in descending order so the most expensive ones are bought first. Each friendâ€™s cost increases with every flower they buy, so the function distributes purchases evenly among friends while tracking how many each has bought. It then returns the total minimum cost.
